You have now successfully scaffolded the entire project! You have a professional `README.md`, a logical file structure, well-commented placeholder code, and sample data. This is a very strong foundation.

Take a moment to review the files and their contents. The next step would be to push all of this to a new GitHub repository. Does everything here look good to you?
