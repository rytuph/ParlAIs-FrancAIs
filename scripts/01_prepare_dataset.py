    1.  Loading raw data from various sources (linguistic textbooks, web scrapes).
    2.  Generating synthetic examples of common grammatical errors.
    3.  Structuring the data into the final instruction-tuning format.
    4.  Performing quality checks and cleaning to ensure high-fidelity training data.
